# Races

The description of races are typically not crucial to gameplay. Races are mostly for role-play and worldbuilding purposes, and may be omitted entirely for certain settings.

## Characteristics Score Increase

A race may provide a basic increase to characteristic scores. This is typically in the form of a base increase, (+5, etc.) or as a random dice-based increase (1d10, etc.)

## Speed

The base speed for humanoid creatures is 10m. Other forms of creatures, and potentially races, may have different speeds.

## Racial Trait

A race will typically provide a trait shared among the members of that race. This would typically be an ability useful in a gameplay context.
