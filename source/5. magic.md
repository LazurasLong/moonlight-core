Level 19             | 472236     |

Level modifiers apply to both exhaustion and difficulty.

In order to calculate difficulty, add the base from the technique and the scale, and any additional modifiers. A successful cast requires a d10 roll that is *higher* than the total difficulty.

Speciality in a technique allows for a -2 to difficulty.

Exhaustion is equal to the difficulty squared divided by 7 (dif^2 / 7) rounded to the nearest number.

Exhaustion decays at a rate of 2/hour.
