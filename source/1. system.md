# System

## Dice

The base dice used for the system is the *d10*, or a 10-sided dice. A percentile roll, the *d100*, may be made by using 2d10, treating the first roll as the value of the tenth digit, and the second roll as the value of the ones digit.

## Characteristic scores

Characteristic scores are key to a character's basic construction. They are an abstraction of a character's basic abilities and characteristics, of everything from their physical to mental attributes, to weapon skills.

The following characteristic scores exist.

### Strength

*Abbreviated as STR.*

**Strength** is a character's basic ability to achieve physical feats. These are mostly those that involve feats of strength, such as lifting, or carrying items, but also include acts such as climbing, and jumping.

Unarmed melee, and brute melee weapons utilise STR rolls.

### Melee Weapon Strength

*Abbreviated as MWS.*

**Melee weapon strength** represents a character's familiarity, and proficiency in utilising complex melee weapons.

All non-unarmed, and brute melee weapons utilise MWS rolls.

### Agility

*Abbreviated as AGL.*

**Agility** represents a character's dexterity, physical flexibility, and nimbleness. A character's initiative is also determined by AGL.

Unarmed ranged weapons utilise AGL rolls.

### Ranged Weapon Strength

*Abbreviated as RWS.*

**Ranged weapon strength** represents a character's familiarity, and proficiency in utilising complex ranged weapons.

All non-unarmed ranged weapons utilise RWS rolls.

### Toughness

*Abbreviated as TGH.*

**Toughness** represents a character's physical resilience and natural defence capabilities. This covers a wide range of different situations, from resisting status effects such as poison, to retaining consciousness after sustaining damage, to surviving when potentially lethal damage is taken.

### Mind

*Abbreviated as MND.*

**Mind** is a abstraction of mental processes and abilities. It covers a character's intelligence, their ability to process and retain information, and their mental capacity and willpower. MND is also used when resisting mental status effects, and to resist damage to memory or mental functions.

### Charisma

*Abbreviated as CHA.*

**Charisma** is a character's ability to charm and coerce. This may be derived from an innate ability to manipulate, but may involve other characteristics, including a character's physical attractiveness, and a character's ability to speak.

### Perception

*Abbreviated as PER.*

**Perception** is a character's ability to notice and perceive their surroundings. This include complex uses of senses, the ability to detect small details, and the ability to passively, and actively detect other characters' actions.

## Checks

Checks are split into two major types.

### Basic Checks

All basic checks are made in a similar fashion. In order to make a check, first determine a the check's difficulty. A basic, challenging difficulty check is equal to the character's relevant characteristic point.

*Check difficulties for basic and trained skill checks and their corresponding modifiers. Please note modifiers are applied to the difficulty of the check, not the roll.*

Difficulty        | Modifier   |
----------------- | -----------|
Trivial           | +40        |
Simple            | +30        |
Routine           | +20        |
Standard          | +10	       |
Challenging       | 0          |
Hard              | -10        |
Very Hard         | -20        |
Painstaking 	  | -30        |
Impossible        | -40        |

After a difficulty has been determined, roll a d100 and compare the roll to the difficulty. If the roll is lower than the difficulty, the check succeeds.

### Skill Checks

**Skill checks** are made when a character utilises a known skill. Making a skill check is the same as making a basic check.

### Characteristic Checks

**Characteristic checks** are made using the base characteristic of a character. The mechanics for characteristic checks vary depending on the situation.

#### Untrained skill checks

Untrained skill checks are made when a character does not possess a skill, but wishes to make a check untrained. In these circumstances, the rules are the same for making a trained skill check, but all modifies receive an additional -10.

*Check difficulties for untrained skill checks.*

Difficulty        | Modifier   |
----------------- | -----------|
Trivial           | +30        |
Simple            | +20        |
Routine           | +10        |
Standard          | 0	       |
Challenging       | -10        |
Hard              | -20        |
Very Hard         | -30        |
Painstaking       | -40        |
Impossible        | -50        |

#### Other Characteristic Checks

Characteristic checks are also made in other situations, such as when resisting status effects, rolling in combat, and most other circumstances when skills do not apply. Making these checks is the same as making a basic check.

### Opposing Checks

An opposing check is made when a character uses a skill or characteristic against another character. In these situations, a basic check is made for both characters with the applicable modifiers. The character closest to success, or with the greatest success, succeeds the check.

In an opposing check, it is impossible for both parties to fail or succeed.
