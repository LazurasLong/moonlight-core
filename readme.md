# Moonlight

Project Moonlight is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) based on a flexible percentile (d100) system designed to be familiar, yet streamlined. This is the "source" text of the system, meant to be the core for any content built on top of the system.

Project Moonlight is also a _living system_, meaning that many aspects of the system may be changed as it matures. Moonlight is very much in an early state at this moment. The system is functioning, but there is a lack of content, and the potential for poor balance. We welcome filing issues or pull requests to help fix typos, and to make suggestions in relation to mechanics or balance.

You'll find the markdown source, broke down into chapters, in the [source](source) folder. The [build](build) folder contains a shell script to build the source into more easily consumable formats. Building requires [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and the relevant dependencies for the format.
