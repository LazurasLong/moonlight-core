# Moonlight

Project Moonlight is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) based on a flexible percentile (d100) system designed to be familiar, but streamlined. This is the "source" text of the system, meant to be the core for any content built on top of the system.

Moonlight is inspired by RPGs like Wizards's D&D, and Fantasy Flight's Dark Heresy.

You'll find the markdown source, broke down into chapters, in the [texts](/text) folder. This repository includes a script to build the HTML document found at [trnglina.org/moonlight](https://trnglina.org/moonlight).

To build the document, you need NodeJS and npm. Run `npm install && npm run build` in the root folder.
