# Moonlight

Project Moonlight is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) based on a flexible percentile (d100) system designed to be familiar, but streamlined. This is the "source" text of the system, meant to be the core for any content built on top of the system.

You'll find the markdown source, broke down into chapters, in the [source](source) folder. The [build](build) folder contains a Windows batch script to build the source into more easily consumable formats. Building requires [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and the relevant dependencies for the format.

The Moonlight Core Ruleset is available under the [CC0-1.0 license](license.txt). This means it is under the public domain, available for re-use and re-distribution, free of charge, no credit neccessary.

All relevant code is also available under the [CC0-1.0 license](license.txt).
