# Percentile system

Project Moonlight utilises what we call a percentile system. This means that the d100 is the die that is used for the majority of checks and basic actions. This page assumes you are experienced in RPGs and that you simply would like to know how the system functions. If you are unfamiliar, please read the [Basics](basics.md) first.

## Basic Checks

Basic check resolutions in the d100 system are simple. On a difficulty zero check (standard), the goal is simply to roll the d100 so that the result is lower than the relevant skill or attribute plus or minus any relevant modifiers. In this system, _modifiers are added to the base stat not the roll_. [Degrees of success](#degrees-of-success-and-failure) may also be necessary on certain checks.

Difficulty        | Modifier   |
----------------- | -----------|
Trivial           | +40        |
Simple            | +30        |
Routine           | +10        |
Easy              | +5         |
Standard          | 0          |
Challenging       | -10        |
Hard              | -20        |
Very Hard         | -30        |
Painful           | -40        |
Impossible        | -50        |

## Partial Successes

Checks may succeed partially if they are within two degrees of failure. If a normal check partially succeeds, the successful result will happen, but there will be a caveat. For example, if someone partially succeeded on a deception check, they may decieve the person, but the person may continue to be suspicious, or the effects will wear off.

## Degrees of Success and Failure

A single degree of success is counted for every ten a d100 roll beats a base difficulty. For example, if a check difficulty was 50, and the d100 roll was 30, we would say that roll had 2 degrees of success.

The degree of failure is similar, but counts every ten a d100 roll is above a base difficulty. If a check difficulty was 50, and the d100 roll was 72, we would say that roll had 2 degrees of failure.

## Opposing Checks

An opposing check is made when a character uses a skill or attribute against another character. In these situations, a normal skill check is made for both characters with the applicable modifiers. The character with the _least_ degrees of failure, or the _most_ degrees of success wins.

## Attributes and Skills

Project Moonlight utilises a system that involves base attributes and sub attributes.
